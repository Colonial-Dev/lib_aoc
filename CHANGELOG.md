# Changelog

# v 0.7.0
- Tests generated by the `derive_tests` macro now only execute the part of the solution under scrutiny.
- Type definitions for `Solution::Output` must now implement `Display` instead of `Debug`, in order to better support string solutions (especially multiline ones.)
- `Solution::part_one` and `Solution::part_two` now return a value of type `Self::Output` directly, rather than requiring that it be wrapped in an `Option`. Detection
of unimplemented solutions is now performed using panicking and `std::panic::catch_unwind`.
- The `testing` parameter has been removed from the `Solver::display` and `Solver::finalize` methods, as these
methods are now only called in non-test contexts.
- Added the `Split` type for handling problems with answer types that differ between parts.

## v 0.6.1/0.6.2
- Fixed a (very silly) bug with the display implementation of `Timings`.

## v 0.6.0
- The `Test` trait's `expected` method now takes a boolean indicating which part is being requested and returns a single instance of `Self::Output`.
- The prelude now contains the constants `PART_ONE` and `PART_TWO` (corresponding to `false` and `true` respectively) that can be used when implementing the aformentioned `expected` method.
- The `Solver` trait's `load` method has been split into `load` and `load_test`, with each method now only taking the requested day (as a `u8`.) `load_test` has a panicking default implementation.
- `Outcome` now exposes benchmark durations via the `Timings` type.
